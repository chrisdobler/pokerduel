Poker Scoring Application

![screenshot](/screenshot.jpg "screenshot")

The Challenge:

Please build an application that showcases all the hands, what hand each player had and who won for each. There must be a tally for the total number of wins for each player. Tests are also a required element and must (at the minimum) show the happy path for the application. The visual does not have to be elegantly designed, but the data presented must be logically grouped and organized so it is very clear what is being presented.
